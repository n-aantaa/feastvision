# Feast Vision - Recipe Website

Welcome to the **Feast Vision** project! This is a recipe website where users can explore and filter various recipes from different cuisines and dietary preferences.

## Project Overview

The website allows users to:
- Search for recipes by name.
- Filter recipes by cuisine and dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).
- View detailed pages for each recipe.

## Features

- **Dynamic Recipe Cards**: Recipes are dynamically displayed using JavaScript. The content is stored in an array of objects, and recipe cards are generated based on user input and filters.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for recipes by name using a search bar.
- **Filter Functionality**: Users can filter recipes by cuisine (Italian, Mexican, Indian, etc.) and dietary restrictions (Vegan, Gluten-Free, etc.).
